JS Algorithm
1. Save the Data (in an array of objects)
2. Generate HTML for that data
3. Make it interactive

Modules Algorithm
1. Add 'type="module"' in the <script> tag of the js file you want to make module.
2. Add 'export' before the element you want in your module
3. Write 'import {element name as xyz} from 'Source path'; in the header of your module file.

Points
1. We can not import from js files which are of type module.
2. Want to remove a product from the website? => Use '.remove()'.
3. Want to make an element disappear then reappear at some point, manipulate its opacity using 
	document.querySelector('.element-class).style.opacity = 1; (Appear)
	document.querySelector('.element-class).style.opacity = 0; (Disappear)

<span> vs <div> vs <p>
1. <span> -> inline
2. <div> -> block
3. <p> -> block
-> Thats it.
